# Forensic Agent Capabilities (v1.0.0)

This document lists the diagnostic tools available to each specialist agent in the Forensic Council.

> **Court-defensibility is per-finding and tier-dependent — not a blanket guarantee.**
> The ✅ below marks tools whose *primary* mode is court-defensible. At runtime each
> finding carries its own `court_defensible` flag: **screening-tier** tools
> (e.g. frequency/FFT GAN heuristics, `reverse_search` OSINT, classical
> copy-move/noise screening) and **research-tier** non-commercial models
> (BusterNet, F3-Net, ManTra-Net, TruFor, AASIST — gated behind
> `ENABLE_RESEARCH_MODELS`, never enabled in production) report
> `court_defensible: false` and are advisory only.
