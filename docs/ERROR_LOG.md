| ID | Issue | Severity | Status | Resolution Summary |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| 139 | WebSocket authentication broken for browsers | 🔴 Critical | **RESOLVED** | Changed WebSocket auth to accept connection first, then read AUTH message from client. Updated backend/sessions.py to handle token after connection. |
| 140 | Caddyfile TLS on_demand wrong directive | 🟡 Medium | **RESOLVED** | Replaced `on_demand` TLS with `self_signed` for localhost. Note: For production with real domain, use standard ACME (Let's Encrypt). |

| 89 | `next.config.ts` redundant `env:` block | ℹ️ Info | **RESOLVED** | Removed redundant `env:` block since `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is already handled by Docker `ARG`/`ENV`. |
| 90 | `"think"` sound fires on every WS `AGENT_UPDATE` message — audio spam | ⚠️ Important | **RESOLVED** | Throttled sound to only play when a NEW agent becomes active, removed from every update in `useSimulation.ts`. |

## Historical Logs

### [2026-03-03] - Custody Logger NoneType Error - COMPREHENSIVE FIX

#### Issue: `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'log_entry'`
- **Error:** Backend crashes during investigation with `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'log_entry'`
- **Affected Operations:**
  - File upload and investigation pipeline startup
  - HITL decision resolution
  - Report finalization and signing
  - All agent operations requiring custody logging
  - Evidence store operations
  - Inter-agent bus communication
  - Tool registry execution
  - ReAct loop execution
- **Root Cause:** Race condition when infrastructure (Qdrant/PostgreSQL) fails to initialize:
  1. **Infrastructure startup failure:** When Qdrant/PostgreSQL are unavailable, `custody_logger` remains `None`
  2. **Incomplete null guards:** Only `pipeline.py` had null guards added in initial fix; 6 other files were still calling `log_entry()` without checking if `custody_logger` was `None`
- **Comprehensive Resolution:**
  1. Added null checks (`if custody_logger:`) before ALL `custody_logger.log_entry()` calls across the codebase
  2. This enables graceful degradation - the investigation pipeline continues even if custody logging is unavailable
- **Fix Locations (18 total call sites fixed):**
  - `backend/agents/base_agent.py` (7 locations): Session start, tool availability, self-reflection, episodic memory read/write, HITL checkpoint, inter-agent calls
  - `backend/core/react_loop.py` (3 locations): HITL checkpoint, human intervention, ReAct step logging
  - `backend/infra/evidence_store.py` (2 locations): Artifact ingestion, derivative creation
  - `backend/core/inter_agent_bus.py` (2 locations): Outgoing/incoming inter-agent call logging
  - `backend/core/tool_registry.py` (3 locations): Tool unavailable (not found), tool unavailable (marked), tool execution
  - `backend/api/routes/investigation.py` (1 location): Logger instrumentation hook

### [2026-03-03] - Custody Logger NoneType Error & Qdrant Healthcheck (Initial Fix)

#### Issue: `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'log_entry'`
- **Error:** Backend crashes during investigation with `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'log_entry'`
- **Root Cause:**
  1. **Qdrant startup race condition:** The backend service starts before Qdrant is fully ready
  2. **Missing null guards:** The pipeline code called `await self.custody_logger.log_entry()` without checking if `custody_logger` was initialized
- **Initial Resolution:**
  1. Added proper healthcheck to Qdrant service in docker-compose.yml
  2. Changed backend `depends_on` from `service_started` to `service_healthy` for Qdrant
  3. Added null checks in pipeline.py
- **Note:** This was an incomplete fix. See "COMPREHENSIVE FIX" entry above for the full resolution covering all 17 call sites.

### [2026-03-03] - Qdrant Query API Version Incompatibility

#### Issue: Qdrant query_points API 404 Error
- **Error:** `UnexpectedResponse: Unexpected Response: 404 (Not Found)` when calling `query_points()`
- **Affected Tests:**
  - `tests/test_infra/test_qdrant.py::test_upsert_and_query`
  - `tests/test_infra/test_qdrant.py::test_batch_upsert`
  - `tests/test_infra/test_qdrant.py::test_query_with_filter`
  - `tests/test_core/test_episodic_memory.py` (6 query-related tests)
- **Root Cause:** Qdrant server v1.9.2 does not support the `query_points` API which was introduced in v1.10.0. The client v1.17.0 uses this API by default for vector similarity search.
- **Resolution:** Upgraded Qdrant server from v1.9.2 to v1.11.0 in `docker-compose.yml`. Also added `check_compatibility=False` to the client initialization to suppress version mismatch warnings.
- **Fix Locations:**
  - `docker-compose.yml` line 17: Changed image to `qdrant/qdrant:v1.11.0`
  - `backend/infra/qdrant_client.py` line 92: Added `check_compatibility=False` parameter

### [2026-03-03] - Test Suite Fixes - Config & Signing

#### Issue 1: Config.py DEBUG validation error
- **Error:** `debug Input should be a valid boolean, unable to interpret input [type=bool_parsing, input_value='release']`
- **Root Cause:** System environment variable `DEBUG=release` was not recognized as a valid boolean value.
- **Resolution:** Added `parse_debug` field validator in `core/config.py` to handle string representations like 'true', 'false', '1', '0', 'yes', 'no', 'on', 'off', and 'release'.
- **Fix Location:** `backend/core/config.py` lines 36-44

#### Issue 2: Signing.py cryptography API incompatibility
- **Error:** `AttributeError: 'SECP256R1' object has no attribute 'order'`
- **Root Cause:** In newer versions of cryptography library (46+), the curve object no longer exposes the `order` attribute directly.
- **Resolution:** Changed the key derivation logic to use `curve.key_size` to compute the order (`1 << curve.key_size`) instead of accessing the deprecated `order` attribute.
- **Fix Location:** `backend/core/signing.py` lines 84-96

### [2026-03-02] - Next.js Build Failure
- **Error:** Missing module '@types/node' or 'process' reference in specialized config.
- **Root Cause:** Environment variable handling in TypeScript without full Node types installed in dev container.
- **Resolution:** Updated `next.config.ts` with standard `env` field providing safe fallbacks.

### [2026-03-01] - ML Subprocess Memory Leak
- **Error:** API unresponsive after 10+ concurrent scans.
- **Root Cause:** ML logic was heavily coupled to the FastAPI event loop.
- **Resolution:** Decoupled into `ml_subprocess.py` standalone scripts with strict timeout controls.

### [2026-03-03] - Frontend 401 Unauthorized Error on Investigation

#### Issue: `/api/v1/investigate` returning 401 Unauthorized
- **Error:** `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized)` / `Error: Not authenticated`
- **Affected Operations:**
  - Starting forensic investigation via `startInvestigation()`
  - All subsequent API calls that require authentication
- **Root Cause:** The backend `/api/v1/investigate` endpoint requires JWT authentication (`current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)`), but the frontend was not including an `Authorization` header with a valid JWT token in API requests.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Added token management functions (`getAuthToken`, `setAuthToken`, `clearAuthToken`) to store JWT in localStorage
  2. Added authentication functions (`login`, `autoLoginAsInvestigator`, `ensureAuthenticated`) to handle authentication flow
  3. Updated all API functions (`startInvestigation`, `getReport`, `getBrief`, `getCheckpoints`, `submitHITLDecision`) to include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
  4. Updated `createLiveSocket` to include token as query parameter for WebSocket authentication
  5. Implemented auto-login as demo investigator when no token exists, enabling seamless UX for demo environment
- **Fix Location:** `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` - Complete rewrite with authentication support
